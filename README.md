# 🧠 An Explainable MONAI-Based Deep Learning Framework for Multi-Class Brain Tumor Classification from MRI Images

A deep learning research project for **4-class brain tumor classification from MRI images**, comparing CNNs and Vision Transformers and exploring Explainable AI (XAI) techniques.

## 🟠 Models

- **MONAI DenseNet121**: CNN-based classifier
- **MONAI EfficientNet**: CNN-based classifier
- **ViT-Base (timm)**: Vision Transformer classifier
- **ViT (MONAI)**: Vision Transformer classifier
- **Swin Transformer-Tiny (timm)**: Swin Transformer classifier
- **Swin Transformer (MONAI)**: Swin Transformer classifier `not able to as training is too heavy`
- **Custom CNN + ViT Hybrid**: Hybrid architecture

### Explainable AI (XAI)

- **Grad-CAM**: Planned for conventional CNN-based models, including DenseNet121 and EfficientNet.
- **Attention Rollout**: Planned for transformer-based models, including ViT and Swin Transformer.

> The transformer-based Attention Rollout implementation is not yet complete. MONAI Swin Transformer training has not been completed.

## 📊 Evaluation

Models are evaluated using:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

| Model                    | Accuracy | Precision |  Recall | F1-score |
| ------------------------ | -------: | --------: | ------: | -------: |
| DenseNet121 (MONAI)      |   94.72% |    95.22% |  94.72% |   94.63% |
| ViT-Base (timm)          |   97.97% |    98.01% |  97.97% |   97.97% |
| ViT (MONAI)              |   80.08% |    84.40% |  80.08% |   75.71% |
| EfficientNet (MONAI)     |   78.46% |    80.82% |  78.46% |   76.69% |
| Swin Transformer (timm)  |  100.00% |   100.00% | 100.00% |  100.00% |
| Swin Transformer (MONAI) |      N/A |       N/A |     N/A |      N/A |
| Custom CNN + ViT Hybrid  |   89.02% |    91.24% |  89.02% |   88.38% |

> Note: These are the currently reported results. The 100% Swin Transformer result has not been independently verified. Further checks for data leakage, split independence, and evaluation correctness are necessary before drawing conclusions. Results across implementations may also differ because of pretrained weights, preprocessing, and training configurations.

## 🔎 Explainable AI

### Grad-CAM for CNN-Based Models

Grad-CAM is planned for conventional CNN-based architectures such as DenseNet121 and EfficientNet. It will generate spatial heatmaps highlighting image regions that contribute to a model's predictions.

### Attention Rollout for Transformer-Based Models

Attention Rollout is planned for transformer-based architectures, including ViT and Swin Transformer. The implementation and visualization pipeline have not yet been completed.

Swin Transformer uses hierarchical, window-based attention, so its explanation method will need to account for its architecture.
